## Feasibility of Using Stripe Elements
Stripe Elements provide pre-built UI components for handling common payment-related tasks. They can significantly reduce the complexity of building custom forms for payment and address information, ensuring that you're compliant with security standards like PCI DSS.

## Payment Element
- The Payment Element allows you to collect payment details in a single, unified UI component. It supports multiple payment methods and dynamically adjusts to display only the methods you’ve configured in the Stripe Dashboard.
## Address Element
- The Address Element can be used to collect address information from your customers, with built-in validation and formatting tailored to the customer’s region.
## Express Payment
- Express Payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay can be integrated to provide a faster checkout experience. These options leverage the Payment Request Button, a part of Stripe Elements, which offers a streamlined payment process.

## Credentials Needed for Client-Side Integration
To integrate Stripe Elements on the client-side, you need the following credentials:

- Publishable API Key: This key is used on the client side to initialize Stripe.js and create instances of Stripe Elements. It can be found in your Stripe Dashboard under the API keys section.
- Secret API Key (server-side): While not directly used in the client-side integration, you need the secret API key on your server to create PaymentIntents or SetupIntents, which you will use to securely process payments.

##  Capturing Data in the Forms
Here’s a high-level overview of how to capture data using Stripe Elements:

### 1 Initialize Stripe and Elements
```
 // Load Stripe.js
 const stripe = Stripe('your-publishable-key');

 // Create an instance of Elements
 const elements = stripe.elements();
```

### 2 Create and Mount the Elements

```
// Create an instance of the Payment Element
 const paymentElement = elements.create('payment');

 // Mount the Payment Element to a DOM element
 paymentElement.mount('#payment-element');

 // Similarly, for Address Element
 const addressElement = elements.create('address');
 addressElement.mount('#address-element');
```

### 3 Handle Form Submission

```
const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');

 form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    
    const { error, paymentMethod } = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
        type: 'card',
        card: paymentElement,
        billing_details: {
            // Add any additional billing details here
        },
    });
    
    if (error) {
        // Display error to the customer
        console.error(error);
    } else {
        // Send paymentMethod.id to your server to process the payment
        // Example: axios.post('/pay', { paymentMethodId: paymentMethod.id });
    }
});
```

## Server-Side Handling
On your server, you need to handle the creation of PaymentIntents or SetupIntents. Here’s an example using Node.js with Express:

```
const express = require('express');
 const app = express();
 const stripe = require('stripe')('your-secret-key');

 app.post('/create-payment-intent', async (req, res) => {
    const { paymentMethodId, amount } = req.body;
    
    try {
        const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
            amount,
            currency: 'usd',
            payment_method: paymentMethodId,
            confirm: true, // Automatically confirm the payment after creating it
        });
        
        res.send({ success: true, clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send({ error: error.message });
    }
 });
 
 app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server listening on port 3000'));
```

## Summary
Using Stripe Elements for your checkout migration is feasible and can streamline the process of collecting and handling payment and address information. You need a publishable API key for the client-side integration and a secret API key for server-side operations. Capturing data involves initializing Stripe and Elements, mounting the elements to your DOM, and handling form submission appropriately.
